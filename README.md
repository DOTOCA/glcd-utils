If you get the error of "MSVCP100.dll is missing", that is the most likely problem.

This tool has been tested on Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 8.1

There are two optional downloads for the binary:

- Installer, which will add uninstaller and start menu items
- Zip or 7-Zip file, if you would like to extract and handle the install yourself. The application is "portable".

On Windows 8.1, no uninstall line shows up under "Uninstall a program" (appwiz.cpl).
